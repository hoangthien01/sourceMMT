          Ancient Roman architecture adopted the external language of classical
          Greek architecture for the purposes of the ancient Romans, but was
          different from Greek buildings, becoming a new architectural style.
          The two styles are often considered one body of classical
          architecture. Roman architecture flourished in the Roman Republic and
          to even a greater extent under the Empire, when the great majority of
          surviving buildings were constructed. It used new materials,
          particularly Roman concrete, and newer technologies such as the arch
          and the dome to make buildings that were typically strong and
          well-engineered. Large numbers remain in some form across the former
          empire, sometimes complete and still in use to this day

          Ancient Greek architecture is best known from its temples, many of
          which are found throughout the region, with the Parthenon regarded,
          now as in ancient times, as the prime example.[2] Most remains are
          very incomplete ruins, but a number survive substantially intact,
          mostly outside modern Greece. The second important type of building
          that survives all over the Hellenic world is the open-air theatre,
          with the earliest dating from around 525–480 BC. Other architectural
          forms that are still in evidence are the processional gateway
          (propylon), the public square (agora) surrounded by storied colonnade
          (stoa), the town council building (bouleuterion), the public monument,
          the monumental tomb (mausoleum) and the stadium.

        <h3>Ancient Indian architecture</h3>

          Ancient Indian architecture is the architecture of the Indian
          subcontinent from the Indian Bronze Age to around 800 CE. By this
          endpoint Buddhism in India had greatly declined, and Hinduism was
          predominant, and religious and secular building styles had taken on
          forms, with great regional variation, which they largely retained
          until and beyond the great changes brought about by the arrival of
          first Islam, and then Europeans. Much early Indian architecture was in
          wood, which has almost always decayed or burnt, or brick, which has
          often been taken away for re-use.
