              Photential clients want to see who they'll be working with. They
              want to hire people, not stock photography. We produced a custom
              photo shoot to bring the people of Paterson Bunchanan front and
              center and to underscore the firm's open and welcome style.Vivid
              images illustrate Paterson Bunchannan's wide range of client, as
              well as their commitment to the pituresque region the firm serves.
