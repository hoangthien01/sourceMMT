          We are finally into the ‘Ber’ months of the year. This is my favourite
          time of the year, starting with September when Autumn begins, October
          with Halloween, November for Bonfire Night then ending with December
          and Christmas. With the nights now getting longer and the weather is
          starting to get a bit chillier I am getting ready to wave goodbye to
          Summer (which to be honest never really arrived here for very long
          this year!) and welcome Autumn in with wide open arms. This is
          definitely my most favourite season of them all and here are my ten
          things I love about Autumn. Before the trees lose all their leaves and
          look bare they give us one last hurrah when they turn into a medley of
          beautiful colours. Seeing the pretty colours of the leaves both on the
          trees and underfoot in their shades of yellow, orange, gold, red and
          brown is probably one of my favourite things. Also remember and take
          the obligatory Instagram shot of your feet and the leaves!

          Many people love Autumn for the changing colors of leaves. Trees that
          were once green explode into beautiful hues of gold, red, and orange.
          The colors are especially breathtaking in places like New England in
          the United States, the Douro River Valley in Portugal, and Bavaria in
          Germany, inspiring many people to travel to these spots to take in the
          scenery. If you love pumpkins, then you’re in luck! Pumpkin flavors
          can be found everywhere in Autumn, particularly in traditional
          favorites like pumpkin pie and pumpkin bread, and in more modern
          treats like pumpkin-spiced teas and coffees. Be sure to get your fill
          before the season ends!
