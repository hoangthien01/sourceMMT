        The Briard originated in, and is named for, the Brie historic region of
        north-central France, where it was traditionally used both for herding
        sheep and to defend them.[3][4]: 287  The first written mention of the
        shepherd dogs of Brie is thought to be in the Cours complet
        d'agriculture of Jean-Baptiste François Rozier,[5]: 41  who in 1783
        wrote that the "chien de Brie" was long-haired and usually black;[c]
        that in the open plains there was little danger from wolves, and so the
        dogs were used more for herding than for defence;[d] and that shepherd
        dogs had the task of preventing the sheep from straying into crops or
        vineyards where they might cause damage.[4]: 287 [e][f] Pierre Mégnin,
        writing in 1895, clearly distinguishes the short-haired Chien de Beauce
        – the modern Beauceron – from the long-haired Chien de Brie or Briard.
